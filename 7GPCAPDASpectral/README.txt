=======================================================================
Version: April 19th, 2010

This package contains a Matlab implementation of the Generalized PCA with Polynomial Differentiation and Spectral Clustering. See http://www.vision.jhu.edu/gpca.htm for more information.

The main file of the implementation is gpca_pda_spectralcluster.m. The file gpca_pda_spectralcluster_test.m prepares and applies the algorithm to a simple subspace clustering problem.
